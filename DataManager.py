"""IMPORTANT
we have 2 formats for the txt files that contains data, we can call
the first "pre parsed" and the second is the "parsed" the diferences 
are that the preparsed has always one comma at the end, doesnÂ´t hace
the "[]" that indicates that is a list and the value of json object is between
quotes (so python thinks that is a string) the parsed is completely legible
for python.

pre parsed example: {..."objectJson":"{...}"...},{..."objectJson":"{...}"...},
parsed example:     [{..."objectJson":{...}...} ,{..."objectJson":"{...}"...}]

the daily data is always in pre parsed format, for the moment 
the historic data is always in pre parsed format, but is desirable to change this
to be in parsed format everytime (making the api efficiently)
